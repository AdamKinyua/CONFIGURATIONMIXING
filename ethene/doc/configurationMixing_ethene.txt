NAME
    configuration mixing calculator 

SYNOPSIS
    the algorithm computes configuration mixing between MOs or NOs 

USAGE
    1. Input/Output       
        input.txt         contains matrix files
                          - the first line contains an integer
                            indicating how many matrix files 
                            are there in the input file
                           - subsequent lines contains matrix files with reference matrix 
                           file at the very top

                           ~/configurationMixing/ethene/configurationMixing_ethene.exe -f input.txt > output.txt;
